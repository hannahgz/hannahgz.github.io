I'm Hannah, a sophomore at Harvard studying Computer Science with a secondary in Economics. Some areas I'm passionate about are increasing gender diversity in tech, educational equity, quantative finance, and machine learning. 

This summer, I'll be interning @ [Citadel](https://www.citadel.com/) as a SWE Launch Intern. Previously, I've been @ [Meta](https://about.meta.com/) as a MetaU SWE Intern, @ [Booz Allen](https://www.boozallen.com/) as an Analytics Fellow, and @ [Stanford Prof. Anshul Kundaje's lab](https://sites.google.com/site/anshulkundaje/Home) as a Machine Learning Research Intern.

On campus, I'm a Director of Programming @ [Harvard WECode](https://www.harvardwecode.com/), the largest student-run conference for women in tech in the world. I also serve as the Alumni Director @ [Harvard WiCS](https://www.harvardwics.com/) and as a Case Team Lead @ [Harvard College Consulting Group](https://www.harvardconsulting.org/). Most recently, I also joined the [Peer Concentration Advising](https://www.harvardconsulting.org/) team for the CS Department!

I love exploring new places, playing spikeball on the beach, falling down the rabbit hole of a good [book](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24304067-hannah-zhou), thrifting, watching random YouTube videos, and having meaningful conversations with friends and family.
